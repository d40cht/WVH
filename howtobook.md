* First you need to consider what kind of event you are planning.  Some people want to book the
  Hall for single sessions - some want to hire it for big events, such as lavish weddings.
* For the large scale events, which can involve lengthy occupation, erection and dismantling of
  large marquees etc., we have a three day block booking which runs from 9am Friday to 11.45pm Sunday
* If you are intending to use a Marquee company you must obtain permission from the Village Hall
  Committee in advance.
* For the less elaborate bookings hire is charged by the session – these are from 9 am – 5pm, and
  5pm – 11.45 pm
* To book the hall you first need to let us know when you plan to hold the event – send us a
  message to wythambookings@yahoo.co.uk – to see if it is available when you require.  Please use
  this address if you have any queries at all – we are glad to help.
* Next you will need to download the form on this website and send it with a deposit cheque to
  Village Hall Bookings, 16, Wytham Village, Oxford, OX2 8QA.  Please make cheques payable to
  Wytham Village Hall. For BACS please refer to the committe for bank details.
* The deposit cheque will be cashed on receipt but will be returned to you after your event if no
  damage to the Hall is found after inspection.
* For large scale 3 day events the deposit is £300.  For smaller events it is £100.

  will be subject to any increases that are implemented.  These will only go up incrementally – no
  big jumps!
