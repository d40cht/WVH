Wytham Village Hall is in the heart of the unique village of Wytham, which, though only 4 miles from
Oxford City Centre, is a haven of rural peace.  The Hall is run by a charitable trust and all
proceeds from events and hires go towards the maintenance of this important community resource.

The Village Hall hosts a variety of community events throughout the year and is also available for
private hire.  It is a popular venue for weddings, parties, concerts, plays, dinners, talks,
away-days, art exhibitions and much more.  It is a beautiful setting for any event.  The capacity
of the hall is 100 people and there are tables and chairs for this number.

Built in the 1920â€™s, it is a beautiful building with wooden floors and beams and a magnificent
picture window looking out over the cricket pitch and orchard.  The Hall has recently been
refurbished and is always kept to a very high standard.  

Inside it comprises a large main room with a small stage, a smaller adjacent room, the kitchen, a
store room for the tables and chairs, and toilet facilities.  It is suitable for disabled patrons.  

A fenced grassy area surrounds the hall for the use of hirers, and smaller gazebo type covers and
BBQs can be erected here if wished.  The Hall is adjacent to the rolling greenery of the village
recreation ground, where there is also a small fenced playground.  These are open to all.
