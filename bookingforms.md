Wytham Village Hall is not licensed to sell alcohol. However, we are allowed a very small number of
Temporary Event Notices each year. We have to apply for these from the Vale Of The White Horse
District Council. If you want to SELL alcohol at your event you need to seek the permission from
the Wytham Village Hall Committee. In order to do this, please download, complete, print and sign
the following Vale of White Horse form. WE WILL NEED THIS FORM AT LEAST ONE MONTH BEFORE YOUR
EVENT.

For the TEN Form please click [here](http://www.whitehorsedc.gov.uk/services-and-advice/business/licensing/temporary-events-notices).
  
If you have any questions about booking the Village Hall or require further information please
email: wythambookings@yahoo.co.uk

We look forward to hearing from you. The Wytham Village Hall Committee.
